# In-Class Task 4: Instructions
**Creating a simple style guide.**

**Deliverable #1**
**Create the Assets (personal logo) and a style for your own personal use.**
Colour palette, font choices, icons, imagery, and any other visual elements use XD, and you can use PSD to fix or crop images to fit the style guide and look, and the Logo file is done in Illustrator AI.  

**Deliverable #2**
**Submit all the assets (logo file and xd file) of the final style guide you created in one XD FILE along with the Illustrator file. See the deliverables list below.**
The finished style guide will be in XD and exported as a pdf.

The logo file is a separate file created in Illustrator. Convert the logotype by selecting the text bounding box, and you should see the baseline of the text. Now outline the text to change it from a font to vector artwork. To do this, go to the type menu in Illustrator>create outlines. 

**Do not ZIP**

1. 1 **XD** file. YourName-Logo.xd
2. 1 **PDF** of the XD file (Exported from XD) 
3. 1 **Illustrator** file. YourName-Logo.ai
