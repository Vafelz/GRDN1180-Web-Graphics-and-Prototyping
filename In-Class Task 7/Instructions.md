# In-Class Task 4: Instructions
You are the product, and you are the brand! Stand out!

Create your own resume portfolio site to show off your work (portfolio, web graphics, coding, style sheets,) your experience, and aspirations.

*"...When you're applying for a job, you're typically asked to submit a resume and cover letter, or maybe your LinkedIn profile. But there are better ways to stand out from your competition, and building a personal website is one of them...While a resume is a sole, largely unchanging document, a personal website can be customized and updated according to what you're working on or what you want to emphasize. It's both fluid and current."*
